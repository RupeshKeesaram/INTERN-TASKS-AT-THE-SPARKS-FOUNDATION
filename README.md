In this particular project we will be developing a simple Linear Regression model which can be able to predict the student Score's (Percentages) based on their study hours. This is one of the simple Linear regression model where we will be using only one feature to train our model.

Here are some of the basic visualizations about HOURS and SCORES

Finally After seeing all the visualizations we can able to say that no of study hours is constantly propostional to the scores gained by the students.
